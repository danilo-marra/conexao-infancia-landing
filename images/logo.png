The file /conexao-infancia-landing/conexao-infancia-landing/images/logo.png is intended to be an image file. Since I cannot generate image files directly, please ensure you have a logo image ready to be placed in that location. You can use any image editing software to create or edit your logo, and then save it as "logo.png" in the specified directory.
